Automatic Ticket Classification NLP Case Study

Problem Statement:

For a financial company, customer complaints carry a lot of importance, as they are often an indicator of the shortcomings 
in their products and services. If these complaints are resolved efficiently in time, they can bring down customer dissatisfaction 
to a minimum and retain them with stronger loyalty. This also gives them an idea of how to continuously improve their services to 
attract more customers. 

These customer complaints are unstructured text data; so, traditionally, companies need to allocate the task of evaluating and assigning 
each ticket to the relevant department to multiple support employees. This becomes tedious as the company grows and has a large customer base.

In this case study, you will be working as an NLP engineer for a financial company that wants to automate its customer support tickets system. 
As a financial company, the firm has many products and services such as credit cards, banking and mortgages/loans. 


Steps that are performed:
perform the following eight major tasks to complete the assignment:

1. Data loading
2. Text preprocessing
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Feature extraction
5. Topic modelling
6. Model building using supervised learning
7. Model training and evaluation
8. Model inference
